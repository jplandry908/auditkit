Running CMMC Level 1 (17 practices) - Open Source

⚠️  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
This scanner tests technical controls that can be automated.

CMMC Level 1 requires 17 practices. Many controls require
organizational documentation and policies that cannot be
verified through automated scanning.

A high automated check score does NOT mean you are CMMC
compliant. This is a technical assessment tool, not a
compliance certification.

You still need to document policies, training, incident
response procedures, and other organizational controls.
