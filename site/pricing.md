## Important Disclaimer

**AuditKit is NOT a complete compliance solution.** You still need:

- **For SOC2:** A CPA firm to perform the audit ($15,000 - $30,000)
- **For CMMC:** A C3PAO to perform the assessment ($25,000 - $150,000)
- **For PCI-DSS:** A QSA to certify compliance ($15,000 - $50,000)

**What AuditKit does:** Automates technical control scanning and provides remediation guidance

**What AuditKit doesn't do:** Replace auditors, create policies, handle organizational controls, or certify compliance

**All cost estimates on this page are approximate and include required auditor/assessor fees.**
