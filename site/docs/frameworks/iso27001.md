**What AuditKit does NOT cover:**
- ISMS documentation (policies, procedures, records)
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Internal audits
- Management review
- Continual improvement processes
- Organizational controls requiring human processes

**Use for:** Technical control assessment as part of ISO 27001 compliance program
**Don't use for:** Sole evidence of ISO 27001 certification
**Hire a consultant for:** Complete ISMS implementation and certification audit

## ISO 27001 vs Other Frameworks

| Framework | Overlap with ISO 27001 | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| **SOC2** | High | Similar technical controls |
| **NIST 800-53** | Very High | Most ISO controls map to 800-53 |
| **PCI-DSS** | Medium | PCI more prescriptive |
| **CMMC** | High | Both based on similar principles |
| **ISO 27017** | Extension | ISO 27001 + cloud-specific controls |
| **ISO 27018** | Extension | ISO 27001 + privacy controls |

**Key Differentiators:**
- ISO 27001 is international (global recognition)
- Requires formal ISMS (not just controls)
- Risk-based approach (tailor controls to risks)
- 3-year certification cycle
- Requires internal audits and management review

**Accreditation:** Look for UKAS (UK), ANAB (US), DAkkS (Germany), JAB (Japan)

**Industry Experience:** Choose CB with experience in your industry

**Global Recognition:** Major CBs:
- BSI (British Standards Institution)
- SGS
- Bureau Veritas
- LRQA
- TUV

## Common ISO 27001 Gaps

Based on certification audit findings:

1. **Incomplete risk assessment** (most common)
2. **Inadequate ISMS documentation**
3. **Insufficient logging and monitoring** (A.8.15, A.8.16)
4. **Weak access controls** (A.8.2, A.8.3, A.8.5)
5. **Missing internal audits**
6. **Poor change management** (A.8.32)
7. **Inadequate security awareness** (A.6.3)
8. **Incomplete Statement of Applicability**

**AuditKit helps with #3, #4, #6** - you need consultants for #1, #2, #5, #7, #8

## FAQ

**Q: Can I get ISO 27001 certified using only AuditKit?**
A: No. AuditKit covers technical controls, but ISO 27001 requires complete ISMS documentation, risk assessments, internal audits, and formal certification audit. Hire a consultant.

**Q: How long does ISO 27001 certification take?**
A: 12-18 months for initial certification. Smaller organizations may achieve it faster (9-12 months).

**Q: What's the difference between ISO 27001 and ISO 27002?**
A: ISO 27001 is the certifiable standard (requirements). ISO 27002 is the implementation guide (best practices). You get certified to 27001, not 27002.

**Q: Do I need to implement all 93 controls?**
A: No. ISO 27001 allows risk-based exclusions. Document justification in your Statement of Applicability (SoA).

**Q: How much does ISO 27001 certification cost?**
A: Small org: $55K-130K initial, $10K-20K annual. Medium org: $130K-265K initial, $20K-40K annual.

**Q: Is ISO 27001 recognized globally?**
A: Yes. ISO 27001 is the most widely recognized information security certification worldwide.

**Q: What happens if I fail the certification audit?**
A: You receive non-conformity reports. Address them within specified timeframe, then CB re-audits. Most organizations pass on second attempt.

**Q: Can I transfer my certificate if I change certification bodies?**
A: Yes, though the new CB may require a transfer audit to verify your ISMS.

**Q: Does ISO 27001 help with GDPR compliance?**
A: Yes. ISO 27001 addresses many GDPR security requirements, though GDPR has additional privacy-specific requirements.

## ISO 27001 and Cloud

**Shared Responsibility:**
- Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) have ISO 27001 certification for their infrastructure
- You're responsible for your applications and configurations
- Use cloud provider inherited controls in your SoA

**Cloud-Specific Controls:**
- A.5.23: Information security for use of cloud services
- A.8.20-22: Network security (cloud networks)
- A.8.24: Cryptography (cloud encryption)

**AuditKit helps verify your cloud configurations align with ISO 27001 requirements.**
