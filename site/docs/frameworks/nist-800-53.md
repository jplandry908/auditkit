# NIST 800-53 Rev 5

NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 guide.

---

## Overview

**NIST 800-53** is a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems.

**Who needs it:** Federal contractors, FedRAMP Cloud Service Providers  
**Certification:** Not a certification itself (used by FedRAMP, FISMA)  
**Total controls:** ~1,000 controls  
**AuditKit coverage:** ~150 automated technical controls  
**What's not covered:** ~850 organizational/policy controls

---

## How AuditKit Uses 800-53

**Framework crosswalk:** AuditKit maps existing SOC2, PCI-DSS, and CMMC controls to NIST 800-53 control families.

**Example:**
```
Your SOC2 control: CC6.6 - MFA enforcement

Maps to NIST 800-53:
- IA-2: Identification and Authentication
- IA-2(1): Multi-Factor Authentication
- IA-5: Authenticator Management
```

**Benefit:** Run one scan, see compliance across all frameworks

---

- SC-13: Cryptographic Protection

### SI - System and Information Integrity
**AuditKit checks:** Malware protection, patch management, flaw remediation

**Example controls:**
- SI-2: Flaw Remediation
- SI-3: Malicious Code Protection

### SR - Supply Chain Risk Management
**What AuditKit checks:** Limited - mostly organizational policies

---

## What AuditKit Automates

**Technical controls (~150):**
- Access controls and authentication
- Logging and monitoring
- Encryption and key management
- Network security
- Vulnerability management
- Configuration management
- Incident detection
- Backup and recovery

**What AuditKit doesn't cover (~850 controls):**
- Organizational policies
- Training programs
- HR procedures
- Physical security
- Risk assessments
- Contingency planning
- System acquisition
- Privacy controls

## Running 800-53 Scan

```bash
# AWS
auditkit scan -provider aws -framework 800-53

# Azure
auditkit scan -provider azure -framework 800-53

# GCP
auditkit scan -provider gcp -framework 800-53

# Generate report
auditkit scan -provider aws -framework 800-53 -format pdf -output nist-report.pdf
```

**Output shows:**
```
[FAIL] IA-2, IA-2(1), IA-5 - Authentication Controls (via CC6.6)
  Issue: 12 users without MFA enabled
  Source: SOC2 CC6.6 maps to NIST IA-2
  
[PASS] AU-2, AU-3, AU-12 - Audit Logging (via CC7.1)
  Source: SOC2 CC7.1 maps to NIST AU-2
```

## FedRAMP Baselines

NIST 800-53 is used by **FedRAMP** (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) for cloud services.

### FedRAMP LOW
- ~125 controls
- Low-impact data
- Public information

### FedRAMP MODERATE
- ~325 controls
- Moderate-impact data
- Most common baseline

### FedRAMP HIGH
- ~421 controls
- High-impact data
- National security systems

**Note:** AuditKit helps with technical controls, but FedRAMP requires full 800-53 implementation including all organizational controls.

## 800-53 vs Other Frameworks

| Framework | Total Controls | Automated by AuditKit |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| NIST 800-53 | ~1,000 | ~150 (15%) |
| SOC2 | 64 | 64 (100%) |
| PCI-DSS | 300+ requirements | 30+ (10%) |
| CMMC Level 2 | 110 practices | 33 (30%) |

**Key insight:** SOC2/PCI-DSS/CMMC are subsets of 800-53. Pass those, you're partway to 800-53 compliance.

## Common Use Cases

### Federal Contractor
**Need:** NIST 800-53 compliance for FISMA

**AuditKit approach:**
1. Scan for automated technical controls (~150)
2. Document organizational controls manually (~850)
3. Use scan results as evidence for technical controls
4. Complete remaining documentation

### FedRAMP Applicant
**Need:** FedRAMP authorization

**AuditKit approach:**
1. Start with SOC2 or CMMC (smaller scope)
2. Use 800-53 scan to see gaps
3. Work with FedRAMP 3PAO for full assessment
4. AuditKit provides technical control evidence

### CMMC + Federal Work
**Need:** CMMC Level 2 + NIST 800-53

**AuditKit approach:**
1. Use Pro for CMMC Level 2 (110 practices)
2. Run 800-53 scan to see additional gaps
3. CMMC Level 2 covers ~30% of 800-53 technical controls
4. Document remaining controls

## Cost Estimate

NIST 800-53 compliance costs vary widely:

| Item | Cost (Estimate) |
|------|-----------------|
| AuditKit Free | $0 |
| Gap assessment | $10,000 - $50,000 |
| Implementation | $50,000 - $500,000 |
| Consulting | $100,000 - $1,000,000 |
| FedRAMP 3PAO (if applicable) | $250,000 - $1,500,000 |

**Timeline:** 12-24 months for full implementation

**Note:** These are estimates. Actual costs depend on organization size and current security posture.

## FAQ

**Q: Is NIST 800-53 a certification?**  
A: No. It's a control catalog used by FedRAMP, FISMA, and other compliance programs.

**Q: Do I need all 1,000 controls?**  
A: No. Tailor based on your system's impact level (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH).

**Q: Can AuditKit help with FedRAMP?**  
A: Yes, for technical controls. You'll still need organizational documentation and 3PAO assessment.

**Q: What's the difference between Rev 4 and Rev 5?**  
A: Rev 5 (2020) added supply chain, privacy controls, and reorganized families. AuditKit uses Rev 5.

**Q: Should I start with 800-53 or SOC2?**  
A: Start with SOC2. It's faster, cheaper, and maps to 800-53 technical controls.
