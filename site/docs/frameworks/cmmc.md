# CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)

Complete guide to CMMC Level 1 and Level 2 compliance with AuditKit.

---

## Overview

**CMMC** is a cybersecurity framework required for DoW contractors.

**Why CMMC matters:**
- Required for all DoW contracts (as of November 10, 2025)
- Protects Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- Mandatory for bidding on DoW contracts
- Failure to comply = cannot bid on DoW work

**Certification:** Requires third-party assessment by C3PAO (CMMC Third-Party Assessor Organization)

---

## CMMC & NIST SP 800-171

**CMMC Level 2 is based on NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2**

AuditKit maps all 110 CMMC Level 2 practices to their corresponding NIST SP 800-171 controls.

**Example mapping:**
- CMMC AC.2.007 → NIST 800-171 3.1.2
- CMMC IA.2.081 → NIST 800-171 3.5.3
- CMMC SC.2.179 → NIST 800-171 3.13.1

This means passing CMMC Level 2 = compliance with NIST SP 800-171.
