# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about AuditKit.

---

## General Questions

### Does this replace my auditor?

No. AuditKit automates the **technical controls** portion of compliance audits, but you still need:

- **SOC2:** CPA firm for certification ($15,000 - $30,000)
- **CMMC:** C3PAO for assessment ($25,000 - $150,000)
- **PCI-DSS:** QSA for certification ($15,000 - $50,000)

**What AuditKit replaces:** Technical consultant fees ($30,000 - $100,000) for infrastructure scanning and remediation

**What you still need:** Certified auditor/assessor for final certification

Think of AuditKit as doing the heavy lifting on infrastructure checks, so you can focus on organizational policies and procedures with your auditor.

### Is this a security scanner?

No. AuditKit checks **compliance controls**, not vulnerabilities. 

For security scanning, use tools like:
- **Prowler** - AWS security scanner
- **Scout Suite** - Multi-cloud security auditing
- **Trivy** - Container vulnerability scanning

AuditKit can integrate with Prowler for complete NIST 800-53 coverage.

### Can I scan multiple accounts/projects?

**Free version:** One account/project at a time. Switch between them:

```bash
# AWS - use profiles
auditkit scan -provider aws -profile production
auditkit scan -provider aws -profile staging

# Azure - change subscription
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="sub-1"
auditkit scan -provider azure

export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=project-1
auditkit scan -provider gcp
```

**Pro version:** Scan entire organizations automatically:

```bash
# Scan AWS Organization
auditkit scan -provider aws --scan-all

# Scan Azure Management Group
auditkit scan -provider azure --scan-all

# Scan GCP Folders/Organization
auditkit scan -provider gcp --scan-all
```

**[Upgrade to Pro →](https://auditkit.io/pro/)**

### Why is my compliance score low?

Common reasons:

**1. Security services not enabled**

Enable these first:
- **AWS:** GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail, Security Hub
- **Azure:** Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy, Activity Logs
- **GCP:** Security Command Center, Cloud Logging, Cloud KMS

**2. Basic security controls missing**
- MFA not enforced
- CloudTrail/logging not configured
- Encryption not enabled
- Public access on storage

**3. Old infrastructure**
- IAM keys older than 90 days
- Unpatched EC2 instances
- Legacy security groups

**Fix critical issues first, then re-scan.**

### Does AuditKit make any changes to my infrastructure?

**No.** AuditKit is **read-only**. It only:
- Reads configuration
- Checks security settings
- Generates reports

It **never** modifies your infrastructure.

The `auditkit fix` command generates a script for you to review and run manually.

### What permissions does AuditKit need?

**AWS:** `ReadOnlyAccess` managed policy  
**Azure:** `Reader` role  
**GCP:** `roles/viewer` role  

All read-only, no write permissions required.

## CMMC Questions

### What's the difference between CMMC Level 1 and Level 2?

**CMMC Level 1 (17 practices) - FREE**
- Protects Federal Contract Information (FCI)
- Basic cybersecurity hygiene
- Required for all DoW contractors
- Self-assessment allowed

**CMMC Level 2 (110 practices) - PRO**
- Protects Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- Based on NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2
- Required for contractors handling CUI
- Requires C3PAO assessment

**Example CUI:** Technical specs, mission plans, personnel records, logistics data

**If your DoW contract mentions CUI, you need Level 2.**

### How much does CMMC Level 2 Pro cost?

**$297/month** with 14-day free trial (no credit card required)

Compare to:
- C3PAO assessment: $25,000 - $150,000
- CMMC consultants: $50,000+
- Traditional compliance platforms: $5,000+/year (without CMMC L2)

**[Try Pro free →](https://auditkit.io/pro/)**

### When is the CMMC deadline?

**November 10, 2025** - CMMC requirements start appearing in DoW contracts

DoW contractors must be compliant when specified in contract solicitations. Many contracts now include CMMC Level 1 or Level 2 requirements.

**[Start your assessment now →](./getting-started.md)**

### Can AuditKit prepare me for C3PAO assessment?

Yes, for **technical controls**. AuditKit automates:
- Technical security configuration checks
- Evidence collection guides
- Remediation commands
- Assessment reports

You still need to handle:
- Organizational policies
- Security awareness training
- Incident response procedures
- Physical security measures

**Timeline:** Most contractors fix 80%+ of technical issues in 2-4 weeks with AuditKit.

## Scanning Questions

### How long does a scan take?

**Single account scan:** 2-5 minutes

**Factors affecting speed:**
- Number of resources in your account
- Number of regions (AWS)
- Network latency
- API rate limits

**Pro multi-account scans:** 10-30 minutes depending on organization size

### Can I scan specific services only?

Not currently. AuditKit scans all supported services for the chosen framework.

**Workaround:** Run scan, then filter results in JSON output:

```bash
auditkit scan -format json -output results.json
jq '.controls[] | select(.category == "Storage")' results.json
```

### Can I run scans automatically?

Yes. AuditKit works great in CI/CD:

```bash
# In your CI pipeline
auditkit scan -provider aws -framework soc2 -format json -output results.json

# Check compliance score
SCORE=$(jq '.score' results.json)
if (( $(echo "$SCORE < 80" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "Compliance score too low: $SCORE%"
  exit 1
fi
```

**[CI/CD examples →](./examples/ci-cd/)**

### What if I get rate limited?

Cloud providers have API rate limits. If you hit them:

**AWS:**
```bash
# Reduce concurrent requests (Pro only)
auditkit scan --scan-all --max-concurrent 2
```

**All providers:**
- Run scans during off-peak hours
- Increase service quotas in cloud console
- Contact cloud provider support

```

**HTML** - Interactive, searchable
```bash
auditkit scan -format html -output report.html
```

**JSON** - For automation
```bash
auditkit scan -format json -output results.json
```

### Can I customize reports?

Not in the Free version. Reports follow standard compliance framework formats.

**Pro version:** Reports include:
- Watermarking with license info
- Company branding (coming soon)

## Integration Questions

### Does AuditKit integrate with Jira/Slack/ServiceNow?

Not yet. Currently on roadmap for Q1 2026.

**Workaround:** Use JSON output with custom scripts:

```bash
# Export results to JSON
auditkit scan -format json -output results.json

# Parse and create Jira tickets
python create-jira-tickets.py results.json
```

### Can I use AuditKit with Prowler?

Yes! AuditKit can import Prowler scan results directly:

```bash
# Run Prowler scan first
prowler aws --output-formats json -o prowler-output

# Import into AuditKit with framework mapping
auditkit integrate -source prowler -file prowler-output.json

# Generate PDF report from Prowler results
auditkit integrate -source prowler -file prowler-output.json -format pdf -output prowler-report.pdf
```

This maps Prowler findings to SOC2, PCI-DSS, CMMC, HIPAA, and other compliance frameworks.

**[Prowler integration guide →](./integrations/prowler.md)**

### How do I integrate M365?

AuditKit uses CISA ScubaGear for M365 scanning:

```powershell
# 1. Install ScubaGear (Windows PowerShell)
Install-Module -Name ScubaGear

# 2. Run ScubaGear
Invoke-SCuBA -ProductNames aad,exo,sharepoint,teams -OutPath ./ScubaResults

# 3. Import into AuditKit
auditkit integrate -source scubagear -file ScubaResults/ScubaResults.json
```

**[M365 setup guide →](./setup/m365.md)**

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: AWS credentials not configured"

**Solution:**
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
```

**[AWS setup guide →](./setup/aws.md)**

### "Error: Azure subscription not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
az login
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
```

**[Azure setup guide →](./setup/azure.md)**

### "Error: GCP project not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
```

**[GCP setup guide →](./setup/gcp.md)**

### "Error: Permission denied"

**Cause:** IAM user/service account lacks required permissions

**Solution:**
- **AWS:** Attach `ReadOnlyAccess` policy
- **Azure:** Grant `Reader` role
- **GCP:** Grant `roles/viewer` role

**[Setup guides →](./setup/)**

### Scan results show "INFO" for many controls

**This is normal.** Some controls require manual verification:
- Physical security measures
- Security awareness training
- Vendor management processes
- Incident response procedures

Generate evidence tracker for manual controls:
```bash
auditkit evidence -format html -output evidence-tracker.html
```
